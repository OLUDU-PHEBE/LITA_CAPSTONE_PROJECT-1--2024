### Sales Trend Analysis: 
Analyze sales trends over time, by product category, and geographical regions

- **AVERAGE SALES PER PRODUCT** : Identifying which products are driving revenue growth and which are underperforming is crucial. This information aids the company in making informed decisions regarding product development, marketing strategies, inventory management, and overall business performance. Moreover, it can reveal valuable trends and patterns that inform future strategic planning and decision-making.
  **FORMULA USED**
  ```MICROSOFT EXCEL
=AVERAGEIF(C2:C50001,"GLOVES",G2:G50001)
**RESULT:** This gives the average sales made on GLOVES.

- **TOTAL REVENUE PER PRODUCT** : To assess the overall contribution of each product to the company's total revenue, calculating the revenue generated by each product is essential. This enables the company to understand how revenue is distributed across different products and to identify which ones are the main drivers of revenue. Such insights can guide strategic decisions, such as concentrating on high-performing products, identifying cross-selling or upselling opportunities, and optimizing pricing strategies. Additionally, it can aid in pinpointing products that are underperforming or not meeting revenue expectations, leading to informed decisions about whether to allocate more resources to those products or to discontinue them. Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of the product portfolio, helping companies to optimize their product mix to maximize revenue and profitability.
  
  **FORMULA USED**
  ```MICROSOFT EXCEL
  =SUMIF(C2:C50003,"JACKET",H2:H50003)

**RESULT:** This gives the total sales made on JACKET.

- **TOTAL REVENUE BY REGION**: Understanding the geographical distribution of a company's revenue is crucial for assessing the performance of different regions in contributing to the overall revenue. By analyzing total revenue by region, it's possible to pinpoint which areas are the primary revenue generators and which may be lagging. Such insights enable a company to make strategic decisions about where to focus growth efforts, how to allocate resources efficiently, and ways to refine market strategies. Additionally, this analysis can shed light on regional trends, customer preferences, competitive dynamics, and potential market opportunities, aiding in the customization of marketing, sales, and distribution strategies to meet the needs of customers across various regions and contribute to the company's overall business expansion. In essence, analyzing total revenue by region equips companies with a detailed understanding of their geographic revenue streams, facilitating informed, data-driven decisions that enhance market presence and promote sustained growth.
